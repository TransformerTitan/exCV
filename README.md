Key Components:
1. Core CBM Architecture

ConceptBottleneckModel: Base model that predicts interpretable concepts before final classification
ConceptInterventionModel: Extended version allowing concept intervention during inference
Flexible backbone support (ResNet18/50) with customizable concept dimensions

2. Training Framework

CBMTrainer: Handles joint training of concept prediction and classification
Balanced loss function combining concept accuracy and classification accuracy
Comprehensive metrics tracking for both concept and class performance

3. Interpretability Analysis

CBMAnalyzer: Provides tools for understanding model behavior
Concept importance analysis by class
Concept space visualization using t-SNE
Concept intervention analysis to test causal relationships
Correlation analysis between concepts

4. Trade-off Analysis
Key trade-offs examined:
Interpretability Benefits:

Human-understandable intermediate representations
Ability to debug model reasoning through concepts
Concept intervention for testing hypotheses
Transparency in decision-making process

Accuracy Considerations:

Information bottleneck may limit model capacity
Joint training complexity
Concept quality affects final performance
Balance between concept supervision and end-task performance

5. Evaluation Metrics

Performance: Concept accuracy, classification accuracy
Interpretability: Activation diversity, concept independence, confidence scores
Trade-off Analysis: Balanced assessment of both aspects

Key Features:

Explicit Concept Modeling: Forces the model to learn human-interpretable concepts
Concept Intervention: Allows testing "what-if" scenarios by manipulating concepts
Visualization Tools: t-SNE plots, correlation matrices, importance heatmaps
Comprehensive Analysis: Quantitative metrics for interpretability assessment
Flexible Architecture: Customizable concept dimensions and backbone networks

Trade-off Insights:
The implementation demonstrates that CBMs offer a valuable middle ground between black-box models and fully interpretable methods. While there may be some accuracy trade-off due to the information bottleneck, the gained interpretability often justifies this cost, especially in high-stakes applications where understanding model reasoning is crucial.
